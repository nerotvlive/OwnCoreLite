## How to use ##
***
To use this API you need to copy the <strong>de.nerotvlive.owncorelite.api</strong> package into your project.<br>
And then you need to add the
```de.nerotvlive.owncore.api.Main.enableAPI();```
method in your ```onEnable()``` method in your main class.
Then you need to take a look over the main class from the API ```de.nerotvlive.owncore.api.Main``` and change the prefix, pluginname and the other strings to your plugin information.

After that you are able to use the API in your project.

Expample of use:<br>
To check if an entry is already made  in a config file or create it if not use<br>
```ConfigAPI.checkEntry("Path.To.Entry","DefaultContent",File,YamlConfiguration);```

Or to check if the server runs a legacy version or not:
```
if(ServerAPI.isLegacy()) {
  //Automatic formatted messages
  ServerAPI.sendConsoleMessage("&4This server runs a legacy minecraft version");
} else {
  ServerAPI.sendConsoleMessage("&4This server isn't running a legacy minecraft version");
}
```
